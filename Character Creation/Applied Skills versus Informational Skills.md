# Applied Skills versus Informational Skills #

**Overview**
----
In RPGs skills are an immensely important part of the game, but no system really approaches them without running into one of the following problems:

1. When creating a character you are often forced to choose *between* combat skills and non-combat skills. Being as effective as possible in combat is important, and it's not fun to have to give that up to be a more well-rounded character. 

2. Skills are often used not only to measure a character's proficiency in a task, but also to gauge the summary of what they *know*. This not only limits characters knowledge to a very limited collection of topics, but it also creates a bizarre situation where a bad dice roll can create a blind spot in a character's knowledge base, which then must be roleplayed in perperuity.

3. Informational Skills are disproportionately situational compared to key functional skills in a character's build. A rogue in D&D 3.5 will roll acrobratics *hundreds* of times more often than Knowledge: Religion, so 99% of all rogues put their currency into Acrobatics and not Knowledge: Religion. This, compounded with #1, makes for extremely homogenous character types across the system.

4. When creating a long-running campaign, characters will make several 'checks' with the dice to determine what they already know. This creates a difficult-to-maintain record of gaps in their knowledge (or trivia you might not assume they'd know) and gives no credit to *tangential knowledge;* knowledge they might have picked up in the pursuit of their primary skill.

**Applied Skills versus Studies**
----
We propose that skills be separated out into two categories: **Skills** and **Studies**. They function entirely different from each other but are close connected:

* A *Skill* is something that is checked for the outcome of a single application of that expertise. And doctor has tons of knowledge, but he *rolls* to perform surgery, so *Surgery* is the Skill.

* A *Study* is something that is Referenced, rather than rolled, and does not have a large range of variation. In the example of the Doctor, physiology is a Study, because they know what they know, period- luck of the dice shouldn't be able to change that.

* Skills and Studies are purchased with separate currency at character creation time. 

* Skills, being the directly practiced and applied output of studies, provide a list of studies that they 'unlock'. A character who only has skills in swordfighting will have a much harder time learning ancient languages, because there is no cause to practice it. Conversely, our doctor from the above example has proficiency in the Surgery skills, which means they are able to acquire (or at least acquire at a cheaper rate) the studies of Physiology, Herb-Lore and Spiritualism.

**Example**
----

**Skill:** Smithing

This skill allows the proficient to craft arms and armor using forge and smelter techniques. When creating gear for use or sale, roll this skill to determine the quality of the work.

**Studies**: Geology, Heraldry (Local), Enchantment

**Study: Enchantment**

This is the study of magic as it adheres to objects and locations. A knowledge of enchantment is useful when discerning a curse over a town, or studying an ancient blade to discover what supernatural forces are working their will through it.

**Ranks**:

*Familiar:* You know popular forms of enchantment, and can identify the nature of specific enchantments by spending time studying it.

*Learned:* You know all forms of enchantment except those that are very secret, and can identify specific enchantments on objects by studying them.

*Expert:* You can recognize most enchantments within moments of interacting with them, and you can use a simple Senses check to recognize a curse or compulsion on another creature. You know tidbits of secret schools of enchantment, and the societies behind them.

*Sage:* You are an authority on enchantments, and can detect minute differences between them. With study you can identify the originator of an enchantment. You know the legends and histories of all the secret enchanting circles, including their founders and locations.
