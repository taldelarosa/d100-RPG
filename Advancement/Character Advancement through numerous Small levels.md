# Character Advancement through numerous Small levels
----

This proposal details how characters can make small advances throughout their play using miniaturized leveling system.

**The Standards: Leveling and Character Points**

In traditional RPGs, increases in a character's power are acquired through multiple systems. The two most popular systems, however, are- generally speaking- Character *Levels*, and Character *Points*. Dungeons and Dragons is the most popular example of Character Levels; You adventure, gaining experience towards a new level, and when you attain it multiple areas of your character are suddenly strengthened. GURPS is a great example of a Character Point system; where you spend the currency obtained through adventure at a 'market' of upgrades, allowing you to buy smaller advances more frequently and eschew parts of a 'class' system you might not otherwise enjoy.

Each system has pitfalls, usually resulting from the pitfalls in the *other* system that it seeks to resolve. Character Levels are easy; they give you a route to a more powerful build, a consistent theme, and a balanced set of abilities awarded commensurate to the general power level of the campaign. Conversely, Character Points are complicated, but powerful; you can make Exactly the character you want, building him specifically to your mind's eye's exacting standard. If you want a sorceror who can bench 200 pounds, go for it! If you want a melee fighter with an eidetic memory and a masters in modern dance, just spend the points.

Our system, we believe, is the best of both worlds. We propose Levels, purchased with experience, like D&D; however, the levels will be tiny and there will be *very, very many of them*. A high power character might not only have 100 or more levels, but he'll have those levels in probably ten or more classes!

**Pitfalls of the Standards, and how our system hopes to address them**

*Addressing the problem of leveling delays:* When you are waiting for a level in Dungeons and Dragons, you're not feeling like you're advancing. In later levels the time between levels can be extremely long, and for most classes a level 15 character plays a lot like a level 16 character. By reducing the size of levels and itemizing rewards out, we reward the player frequently, and their character often feels different even from one session to the next. Additionally, with several classes to choose from (and no real obstacles to choosing between them), you won't feel like you're locked into a narrow play style unless your conscious aim is to really specialize.

*Addressing the problem of expensive abilities:* Let's be honest; whenever there is a perk/advantage system that you spend points on, you are roped into a character concept early on because more powerful abilities are *Expensive*. No one is going to save up the 40 CP to take a really big GURPS Advantage after play starts, and even if they did, how is that better than just waiting for a Level? Small, serialized levels disallow shortcutting to the really powerful abilities like Classes do, but they are varied and inexpensive by design to retain looking forward to a big payoff while retaining the thrill of incremental growth.

*Addressing the problem of bottlenecking characters:* Both levels and expensive CP-cost abilities force you to optimize to a playstyle, and to an extent, that's unavoidable; everything has an opportunity cost and you deserve to be rewarded for your dilligence in pursuing excellence in a field. Smaller, diverse levels that offer generic bonuses: +1 to strength here, +1 to Focus with Fire spells there- these allow you to arrive at your late-game character through any number of alternative paths. Sure, there might be a mathematically 'Best' way to reach a power you want as quickly as possible, but there will likely be options along the way, and because growth is so gradual it might just be worth it to take the slightly longer road if it gets you other powers and abilties that you might appreciate.

*Addressing the problem of creating a bad build:* Not everyone can be an amazing mathematician/genius, and sometimes you realize that you should have listened more about statistics in school only after sinking many sessions into your boring or ineffective character. Hell, many of us in our real lives will change occupations and hobbies as the years go on, and inevitably some of our skills wane as we focusing on sharpening others. To model this slow growth, Players may recoup an amount of spent character points equal to their current amount of unspent character points each time they are awarded.
