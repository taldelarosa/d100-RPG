# Hit Points #

**Overview**
----
Damage systems in modern RPGs seem to fall at either extreme of the realism spectrum, with the tradeoff being that the more analaous to reality damage is portrayed as, the more crippling, short and brutal combats are. Since our system is attempting to portray more heroic roleplay, we propose a system that captures some of the familiar elements of realistic injury but retains enough abstraction that the player's characters are not permanently maimed or scarred after each combat.

**The first Challenge: Infinite Bad Guys, Infinite Hit Points**

Tabletop RPGs are analagous to Rogue-like videogames in that the longer you play them, the more risks you take and the more likely your character is to die and often this means the character is removed from play- their story is concluded. Contrast this to the enemies of your characters; until the game is concluded in ultimate victory (often years and in some cases Decades away), there will *always* be another villain, who will have underlings and allies all at full strength vying against the party's progress. In open-ended campaigns, the bad guys can literally have infinite chances to kill the heroes, which means on a long enough line every hero's survivability falls to zero.

This of course influences a large number of game design elements. Adventures (barring Solo ones, for which an ending is appropriate, albeit disappointing) should no longer rely too heavily on the context of a single special person. In fantasy literature, we see the familiar dip of the Hero's journey very often because the ending is pre-determined- we know that the character whose name is on the cover of the book will probably survive these harrowing encounters. Not so when we entrust the fate of characters to dice rolls. Systems incorporate Rest systems that often restore the characters to full health and functionality, resetting the doomsday clock for another day. These systems in turn create a drive for *attrition*; after all, we need tension and the *threat* of destruction to drive decisions and resource management in our players. 

Ultimately, we cannot solve for player mortality without removing the stakes from the game and ruining it. However, we can endeavor through the below system to create varying degrees of threat and danger that make each chapter in the hero's story feel novel and uniquely gripping, and throw a curtain over the simple math of party resources and their next Long Rest.

**The Second Challenge: Combat is Deadly, and Deadly can be a Drag**

In a realistic combat scenario, our bodies are extremely prone to breaking. We see this in boxing matches and cinematic sword fights- the first real injury to a person is crippling, and they very rarely recover from it. The exceptions are in fantastic situations where a hero rallies to stab the bad guy, or the incapacitated soldier outsmarts his overconfident attacker by luring him into a trap or environmental hazard. Regardless, as a stand-up combatant, the first hit you take almost certainly makes you a casualty.

RPGs have been careful to avoid this effect, because it's simply not fun. Taken in hand with Challenge #1 above, combats would become so dangerous that players would be best advised to skip out on the life of an adventurer altogether. However, the alternatives are either extremely simple (D&D has you fighting at 100% until 0 HP where you just drop), or an absolute chore to track (Legends of the Five Rings introduces Wound penalties that stack whenever you are injured). While it's easy to poke holes in D&D's system, there is a lot of criticism of progressive wound systems as well; while it generally accelerates you toward a loss condition, it's also not realistic in the sense that adrenaline often allows us to act even wtih serious wounds.

We must strike a balance that is fun, easy to manage, and most of all creates a system where players can make intelligent decisions about when to draw their weapons.

**Proposal: Tiered Damage and the Shocked state**
----

Our system divides injury into three tiers, described here:

* **Uninjured**. Damage applied against this category of hit point boxes doesn't actually *injure* the character, but rather represents their heroic, storytelling ability to turn deadly wounds in to minor ones, dive for cover and quickly recover from dramatic events. While the character has at least one remaining box in this tier, they are still cool and collected, and able to draw from their entire repertoire of skills and abilities. After danger passes and with a little time to breathe, this sort of 'damage' can be quickly recovered.

* **Impaired**. At this point the character has actually received damage, and is likely operating in an emergency frame of mind. Adrenaline is pumping. The character might be experiencing Shock. Characters reduced to this state experience a loss of mental abilities- without proper training your mind shuts down, and you're capable only of panicked actions like running or attacking madly. At this point you must rely on muscle memory to save you; basic actions and maneuvers represent muscle memory and training serving you in this altered state. Attempting to do anything more complicated; tricking a foe through a clever feint, casting a spell, solving a puzzle; these can only be accomplished if you succeed at some kind of check modified by the amount of damage you have taken.

* **Incapacitated**. At this stage your body fails. It isn't fun to lay on the ground and roll to bleed, so at the point you are still able to make very simple actions. Dragging yourself a short distance. Saying your last words. Throwing the lever that releases the trap. This region of your hit point boxes is where drama lives.

Being driven beyond these states should result in tragedy.

**A Note on Healing**
----
One of the secondary benefits of this system is that healing doesn't necessarily have to come from the same source. Consider two different archetypes; the battlefield commander and the battlefield medic. The Medic will do what the medic always does; use bandages or magic or potions or whatever to recover allies from injury. 

But the Uninjured tier isn't, well, injured. Someone at the Uninjured tier doesn't need a bandage- they need a leader to remove fear, inspire confidence, and remind them of their training. Thus we have the opportunity for a *second* kind of healer- a commander archetype that restores hit boxes at the *uninjured* tier by rallying his troops or just being a solid example of what a soldier is supposed to be. Of course, both roles would be critical in a comprehensive party line up.
